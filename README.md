## 📊 Overview

Fraudulent transactions can severely impact both customers and businesses. This project uses supervised machine learning models to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent**. The pipeline includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Performance evaluation

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name:** Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Format:** CSV
- **Description:** Contains anonymized transaction-level records with features such as amount, location, customer details, and fraud labels.
- **Target Variable:** `is_fraud` (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Genuine)

> 📎 The dataset used in the notebook is loaded as `Fraud Detection Dataset.csv`.

## 🔍 How It Works

**1. Load & Clean Data**

  -   Import CSV

  -   Handle null values, data types, and preprocessing

**2. EDA**

  -   Distribution plots

  -   Correlation heatmaps

  -   Outlier detection

**3. Model Building**

  -   Train/Test split

  -   Random Forest Classifier

  -   Linear Regression (if risk scoring is needed)

**4. Evaluation**

  -   Accuracy Score

  -   Precision, Recall, F1 Score

  -   Confusion Matrix

  - Mean Squared Error (if applicable)
